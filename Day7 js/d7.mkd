# Day 7: Functions in JavaScript

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What are Functions?
A function is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Function Declaration & Invocation
A function is declared using the `function` keyword and executed when called.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Function Parameters & Arguments
Functions can take parameters (inputs) and return a value.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Arrow Functions (ES6)
A shorter syntax for defining functions using `=>`.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Callback Functions
A function that is passed as an argument to another function.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)
A function that runs immediately when defined.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Higher-Order Functions
Functions that take another function as an argument or return a function.

## üî• Tasks for Today:
- Write a function `sayHello` that prints "Hello, World!".
- Write a function `multiply` that takes two numbers and returns their product.
- Convert `multiply` to an arrow function.
- Write a function `calculate` that takes two numbers and a callback function.
- Create an IIFE that logs "Hello from IIFE".
- Write a function `mathOperation` that takes an operation type and returns the corresponding function.
